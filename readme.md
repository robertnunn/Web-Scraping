# Web Scraping

This is a collection of web scraping scripts I've made to help collect data.

## The Scripts
- Astroneer: Collect crafting info from the official astroneer wiki
- basic download: super basic downloader that looks for files in a certain URL that follow a "1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg,..." pattern. Supports classes of extensions (e.g., if downloading a set of images, some might be .jpg and others might be .png, this will automatically handle both)
- imgur album downloader: useful for grabbing images out of an NSFW imgur album 
- web scraping: some of my first practice in scraping
