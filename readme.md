# Web Scraping

This is a collection of web scraping scripts I've made to help collect data. If you're here from the PCGI meetup, all the files I used are in the PCGI folder, along with some more detailed notes.

## The Scripts
- Astroneer: Collect crafting info from the official astroneer wiki
- basic download: very simple script to pull files that are in the same directory and sequentially numbered. Useful for some image galleries
- web scraping: some of my first practice in scraping, downloads all xkcd comics
- webcomic scraper: WIP, trying to create a generalized webcomic downloader
- mangatown: scrapes manga from mangatown
- merge_video: merges separate audio/video streams downloaded via the "youtubedl" plugin for firefox
- gta_bonuses: scrapes and emails the latest GTAO bonuses every thursday morning
- podcast downloader: crude downloader for podcasts, only works with iheartradio podcasts with rss feeds and stitcher
